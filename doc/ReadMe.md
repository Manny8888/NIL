This folder contains a text version of the I-Machine Architecture Specification. The original is a OCR-ed pdf file sourced from bitsavers.org.

The text is formatted in asciidoc markdown.


Two ways to work with asciidoc documents:
- Easy: install the Firefox addon asciidoctor.js, which monitors the adoc file and converts to html on the fly.

- Install asciidoctor-pdf and run `asciidoctor-pdf --verbose [filename.adoc]`.
